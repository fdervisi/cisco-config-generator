ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  mapping values are not allowed here

The error appears to be in '/home/centos/cisco-config-generator/list-test.yml': line 31, column 23, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

      - debug:
          var: ip_list: "{{ ip.msg.split(',') }}"
                      ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"
